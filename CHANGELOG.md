# Changelog

All notable changes to the adanalife OBS image are recorded here. The format is
managed by [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io): every PR into `develop`
adds a fragment under `changelog.d/` (`task changelog:add PR=<n> TYPE=<type>`),
and `task changelog:build VERSION=x.y.z` collates them into this file at release
time.

This image was extracted from the [tripbot](https://github.com/adanalife/tripbot)
monorepo (full git history preserved) and starts a fresh version line at v1.0.0,
published as `ghcr.io/adanalife/obs`. The image content continues from tripbot's
former `adanalife/obs:3.4.1`.

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- Standalone cdk8s deployment for the OBS image: self-contained per-env manifests (prod/stage twitch+youtube, dev, local) that no longer depend on the tripbot cdk8s framework. Synth output is parity-verified against the pre-split manifests; the image now resolves from `ghcr.io/adanalife/obs`. ([#1](https://github.com/adanalife/obs/pull/1))
